# Carnaval

They came from far away, 
they came alone, 
in cloaks of rainbow colors
they had sewn
They came to turn and
they came to spin, 
they came together
carnaval

Chorus:
Bright lights shine
When sorrow fades
the singing comes
voices raised
(repeat)
Bright lights shine 
their mirrors bright
under the stars 
carnaval

In purple and pink, 
in turquoise too, 
kings and queens -
in cloaks of blue
For one night only
time will stop 
until the new dawn breaks 
carnaval

Chorus:

And they gave more than
they could take, 
as if the new day
would never break
They came together
they came apart
the dawn rose red
carnaval

Chorus:
